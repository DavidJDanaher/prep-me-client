Scaffolding for an AngularJS project

## Why?
I created this for two reasons:
1. I wanted to learn more about building front end projects from the ground up;
the dependency configuration, the bundling and minification, etc.

2. I wanted a quicker way to spin up projects that included unit tests,
CSS transpiler, AngularJS dependencies, and some sort of components library.  
That up-front time can cost be prohibitive when creating an app on a short
time-scale.  

I had the choice of using an existing seed app or creating one, so I chose the latter.  
I don't expect this to be useful to others, but I'll be happy if it is.
This setup is very basic.  It would not be sufficient for a production environment
but would hopefully be sufficient for me to create simple to moderately complex
AngularJS applications for personal use or employment opportunities.

## Dependencies In No Particular Order
* AngularJS - (yeah, old school, I know)
* Webpack - (all the cool kids are doing it)
* Mocha - test runner
* Chai - assertions library
* Sass - CSS transpiler
* Ui-kit - super lightweight and awesome components library

### To Setup:
`npm install`

### To Run:
`npm start`

### To Test:
`npm test`
